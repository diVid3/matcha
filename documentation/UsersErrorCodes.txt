IMPORTANT:

Remember that these are ment to signal conditions to requesting agents, not to give user feedback.
E.g. don't send a 401 if a user's login credentials are invalid, a 401 means that the requesting
agent doesn't have the authority to make the request, not that the request contains invalid info.

If you'd like to signal feedback on whether login was successful or not, rather send a 200 feedback
object in the form of { status: false, message: 'No matching credentials.' }
